This expression (not really a word) is the first and last letter of the Hebrew alphabet. It is omitted in every translation I've seen, included the Septuagint. It mystified scholars for millenia until Jesus announced "I am the A to Z" in Revelation 1:8

Glossed over by every translation I've seen, the Hebrew word is, in fact, plural. I have tried to impart this by demonstrating God's "many in one" nature.

Not enough can be made of the fact the Hebrew word, rarely used, can only have God as its subject. This is the kind of making only God can do.

Dr. Humphries published an excellent theory on creation week in his book Starlight and Time. My interpretation of these passages leans on this theory. According to Humphries, the universe started as a great ball of water. "The Deep" is an excellent name for it.
