<p class="noteText"><span class="noteId">a</span>This expression (not really a word) is the first and last letter of the Hebrew alphabet. It is omitted in every translation I've seen, included the Septuagint. It mystified scholars for millenia until Jesus announced "I am the A to Z" in Revelation 1:8
</p>
<p class="noteText"><span class="noteId">b</span>Glossed over by every translation I've seen, the Hebrew word is, in fact, plural. I have tried to impart this by demonstrating God's "many in one" nature.

<span class="verseReference">4</span>And the A to Z God Company saw that the light was good. And the God Company separated (*) the light from the darkness.
<span class="verseReference">5</span>And the God Company named the light Day, and the darkness He named Night. And it was sunset and it was dawn: day one.
